The repo which houses my EIE3106 Lab 1 project files

## What this is

This repo consists of PlatformIO projects files for Arduino Uno and STM32F1 (specifically, Nucleo F103RB) that I created for my school assignments. This is a lab assignment and serves as a hands-on experience with using PWM and ADC with Arduino Uno and STM32.

## Contributing

No.

This repo merely serves to show how terrible some of my earlier code is. Stuff that I have done and learned from this lab assignment will be improved upon in my next projects.
